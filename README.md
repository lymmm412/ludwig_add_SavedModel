# ludwig_add_SavedModel
The official site is [here](https://uber.github.io/ludwig) and the official github repo is [here](https://github.com/uber/ludwig). \
Inspired by the code provided by [ifokeev](https://github.com/ifokeev) in this [issue](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/issues/329), I added 2 functions to save the model as SavedModel format and used freeze_graph.py to freeze the model into a .pb file, which can be used in the model deployment.\
